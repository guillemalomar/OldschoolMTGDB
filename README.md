## Documentation

### Explanation

This project consists in a platform to visualize Oldschool MTG Decks.

## Using the service

### First of all

#### Virtual environment

- I recommend creating a virtualenv for this project. Use the following commands in a terminal to install virtualenv, create a virtual environment, and activate it.
```
~/OldschoolMTGDB$ pip3 install virtualenv
~/OldschoolMTGDB$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
~/OldschoolMTGDB$ source venv/bin/activate
```
After creating it, you should run the following command to install all the pip packages required:
```
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now all pip packages needed have been installed.
You can check your environment packages using the following command:
```
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ pip freeze
```

#### Database set up

You now need to initialize the database with the following commands:
```
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ python manage.py makemigrations
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ python manage.py migrate
```

#### Admin user set up

To create an admin user for the service, type the following command in your terminal:
```
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
It will ask for a username, email (not mandatory) and password.

### Starting the server

We can execute the application with the following command:
```
(venv) ~/OldschoolMTGDB$ python manage.py runserver
```
The output should be really similar to this:

```
